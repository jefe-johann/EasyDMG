# Commercial License

EasyDMG is available under a dual-license model:

## Open Source License (GPL-3.0)

For open source projects and general use, EasyDMG is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

### What GPL-3.0 Allows:
- Free use for personal and commercial purposes
- Modification and distribution of the software
- Creating derivative works

### What GPL-3.0 Requires:
- Source code must remain open and available
- Derivative works must also be licensed under GPL-3.0
- Changes must be documented
- Original copyright and license notices must be preserved

## Commercial License

If you wish to use EasyDMG in a proprietary product without GPL-3.0 restrictions, a commercial license is available.

### Commercial License Benefits:
- Use EasyDMG in closed-source/proprietary applications
- No requirement to disclose your source code
- No GPL-3.0 copyleft obligations
- Priority support (optional)
- Custom feature development (optional)

### Commercial License Pricing:

**Contact for pricing:**
- Email: jeff@yourcontact.com (update with your actual contact)
- GitHub: https://github.com/jefe-johann/EasyDMG/issues

Pricing is based on:
- Number of developers
- Distribution scope (internal use vs. end-user distribution)
- Support requirements

### How It Works:

1. **Contact us** with your use case
2. **Receive a quote** based on your needs
3. **Sign the commercial license agreement**
4. **Receive a license key** and invoice
5. **Use EasyDMG** in your proprietary application

## Why Dual Licensing?

We believe in open source and want EasyDMG to be freely available to the community. However, developing and maintaining quality software requires resources. Commercial licensing allows companies that benefit from EasyDMG in proprietary products to support continued development while keeping the core project open source.

## Questions?

Not sure which license you need? Here's a quick guide:

**Use GPL-3.0 if:**
- Your project is open source
- You're okay with sharing your source code
- You want to use EasyDMG for free

**Need Commercial License if:**
- Your application is closed-source/proprietary
- You cannot or don't want to share source code
- You're embedding EasyDMG in a commercial product
